# Project Instructions

## Getting Started

Welcome to your new **Welcomedly** project! This project was created using CodeGuide CLI and comes with a structured task management system to guide your development process.

## First Steps

### 1. View Your Tasks
The first thing you should do is look at the tasks that have been generated for your project:

```bash
codeguide task list
```

This will show you all the available tasks, organized by status (pending, in_progress, completed).

### 2. Start with Your First Task
Choose a task from the list and begin working on it:

```bash
codeguide task update <task_id> --status in_progress
```

Replace `<task_id>` with the actual ID of the task you want to work on.

### 3. Track Your Progress
As you work on tasks, update your progress:

```bash
codeguide task update <task_id> "your progress notes"
```

When you complete a task, mark it as completed:

```bash
codeguide task update <task_id> --status completed
```

### 4. Continue the Workflow
**Important**: After completing a task, immediately continue to the next available task. Keep this cycle going until all tasks are completed:

1. **Complete current task** â†’ Mark as completed
2. **Choose next task** â†’ Pick from remaining pending tasks
3. **Start next task** â†’ Set status to in_progress
4. **Repeat** â†’ Continue until no tasks remain

This continuous workflow ensures steady progress and prevents stagnation between tasks.

- **AI Guidelines**: See `AGENTS.md` for AI development agent guidelines
- **Tasks Data**: See `tasks.json` for project task structure and information

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Review Tasks**: Always start by reviewing available tasks
2. **Plan Your Work**: Choose tasks that make sense to work on next
3. **Start Tasks**: Use `codeguide task update <task_id> --status in_progress` to begin work on a task
4. **Update Progress**: Keep your task progress updated as you work
5. **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed when finished
6. **Continue to Next Task**: After completing a task, immediately start the next available task until all tasks are done
7. **Generate Documentation**: Use `codeguide generate` for new features

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup Instructions

### When You're Done with Setup

Once you've reviewed all the documentation and are ready to start development, you should clean up the project structure:

#### If this project was created in a subdirectory (not current directory):

1. **Move essential files to the project root:**
   ```bash
   # Move documentation folder to project root
   mv documentation/ ../

   # Move AGENTS.md to project root
   mv AGENTS.md ../

   # Move codeguide.json to project root
   mv codeguide.json ../

   # Move tasks.json to project root
   mv tasks.json ../

   # Navigate to the parent directory
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Remove the now-empty subdirectory:**
   ```bash
   # Remove the subdirectory (replace with actual directory name)
   rmdir <project-subdirectory-name>
   ```

3. **Delete this instructions.md file:**
   ```bash
   rm instructions.md
   ```

#### Your final project structure should be:
```
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ documentation/          # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ AGENTS.md               # AI development guidelines
â”œâ”€â”€ codeguide.json          # CodeGuide project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.json              # Project tasks data
â””â”€â”€ (your source code files)
```

### Benefits of Cleanup:
- **Cleaner project structure** - No unnecessary nested directories
- **Better navigation** - All files are at the project root
- **Professional setup** - Matches standard project layouts
- **Removes setup artifacts** - No temporary instruction files

## Getting Help

- Use `codeguide --help` for general help
- Use `codeguide <command> --help` for command-specific help
- Use `codeguide task list --help` for task management help
