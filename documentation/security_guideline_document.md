# Security Guideline Document

# Welcomedly Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security principles, requirements, and best practices tailored specifically for the Welcomedly Node.js web application. It is intended to guide developers and operators in building, deploying, and maintaining Welcomedly with robust security controls.

## 1. Introduction

Welcomedly is a modular Node.js/Express.js application with a PostgreSQL database (via Sequelize), EJS templates, and file-upload functionality. The platform handles user authentication, campaign management, data uploads, and reporting. Given its handling of sensitive user data and campaign metrics, a defense-in-depth security posture is critical.

## 2. Core Security Principles

*   **Security by Design**: Incorporate security reviews at each development milestone.
*   **Least Privilege**: Grant the minimal permissions to services, database roles, and environment variables.
*   **Defense in Depth**: Implement overlapping controls (e.g., input validation + output encoding + content security policy).
*   **Fail Securely**: Ensure errors do not leak stack traces or PII to clients.
*   **Secure Defaults**: Disable debug modes, verbose logging, and open CORS in production by default.

## 3. Authentication & Access Control

*   **Password Storage**: Use bcrypt (or Argon2) with unique salts. Enforce a minimum of 12 rounds for bcrypt.

*   **Session Management**:

    *   Store sessions in a secure, server-side store (e.g., Redis) with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict` cookies.
    *   Implement idle (e.g., 15 min) and absolute (e.g., 8 hr) timeouts.
    *   Rotate session identifiers upon privilege changes to prevent fixation.

*   **JWT Usage** (if introduced):

    *   Choose a strong algorithm (e.g., `HS256` or `RS256`).
    *   Validate the `exp` claim server-side.
    *   Store signing keys in a secrets manager, not in code or `.env` files.

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Offer an optional TOTP or SMS-based MFA, especially for administrator accounts.

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:

    *   Define roles (`admin`, `agent`, `user`) and map fine-grained permissions.
    *   Enforce authorization checks in Express middleware on every protected endpoint.

## 4. Input Validation & Output Encoding

*   **Server-Side Validation**:

    *   Use a validation library (e.g., `Joi`, `express-validator`) for JSON, form data, and query parameters.
    *   Centralize validation schemas in a `validators/` directory.

*   **Preventing Injection Attacks**:

    *   Use Sequelize parameterized queries (avoid raw SQL where possible).
    *   Sanitize file upload paths to prevent directory traversal.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:

    *   Encode user-supplied data in EJS views with `<%= _.escape(value) %>` or use `ejs-mate` auto-escaping.
    *   Implement a strict Content Safety Policy (see Section 7).

*   **File Upload Security**:

    *   Restrict allowed file types (e.g., `.csv` only).
    *   Enforce maximum file size (e.g., 5 MB) in `multer` configuration.
    *   Store uploads outside the webroot, scan for malware, and generate random filenames.

## 5. Data Protection & Cryptography

*   **TLS Everywhere**:

    *   Enforce HTTPS using Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header.
    *   Use certificates from a reputable CA (e.g., Letâ€™s Encrypt).

*   **Encryption at Rest**:

    *   Encrypt backups of PostgreSQL dumps.
    *   Enable pgcrypto extension for field-level encryption if storing PII.

*   **Secret Management**:

    *   Use AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault for database credentials and API keys.
    *   Avoid committing any secret to git or config files.

*   **Audit Logging**:

    *   Log authentication events, file uploads, and permission changes with secure log levels.
    *   Ship logs to a centralized service (e.g., ELK stack) with restricted access.

## 6. API & Service Security

*   **Rate Limiting & Throttling**:

    *   Apply `express-rate-limit` on authentication endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks.

*   **CORS**:

    *   Allow only trusted origins, e.g., `https://app.welcomedly.com`.
    *   Avoid wildcard (`*`) in production.

*   **HTTP Methods**:

    *   Enforce `GET` for retrieval, `POST` for creation, `PUT/PATCH` for updates, and `DELETE` for deletions.
    *   Reject unsupported methods with `405 Method Not Allowed`.

*   **Versioned API**:

    *   Prefix endpoints with `/api/v1/` for backward compatibility and safe evolution.

## 7. Web Application Security Hygiene

*   **Security Headers** (via `helmet`):

    *   Content-Security-Policy: restrict scripts, styles, and frames to trusted sources.
    *   X-Frame-Options: `DENY` to mitigate clickjacking.
    *   X-Content-Type-Options: `nosniff` to prevent MIME-sniffing.
    *   Referrer-Policy: `no-referrer-when-downgrade`.

*   **CSRF Protection**:

    *   Use `csurf` with synchronizer tokens for state-changing operations.

*   **Secure Cookies**:

    *   Set `secure: true`, `httpOnly: true`, and `sameSite: 'Strict'` for session cookies.

*   **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**:

    *   Include SRI hashes on CDN-loaded assets in your EJS templates.

## 8. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

*   **Server Hardening**:

    *   Disable all unnecessary ports and services on the host.
    *   Run Node.js processes under a non-root, dedicated user.

*   **Configuration**:

    *   Maintain separate `NODE_ENV` for `development`, `staging`, and `production`.
    *   Load environment variables via a vetted library (e.g., `dotenv`) in local setups only.

*   **Patching & Updates**:

    *   Apply OS and package updates regularly (e.g., `apt-get upgrade`).
    *   Automate dependency updates via SCA tools (e.g., Dependabot).

*   **Containerization** (Optional):

    *   Use Docker with minimal base images (e.g., `node:14-alpine`).
    *   Scan container images for vulnerabilities.

## 9. Dependency Management

*   **Lockfiles**:

    *   Commit `package-lock.json` to ensure deterministic builds.

*   **Vulnerability Scanning**:

    *   Integrate `npm audit`, Snyk, or GitHub Advanced Security into CI pipelines.

*   **Minimal Footprint**:

    *   Remove unused packages and audit transitive dependencies.

## 10. Continuous Integration & Testing

*   **Security Tests**:

    *   Include automated tests for XSS, SQL injection, and CSRF in your test suite.

*   **Integration Tests**:

    *   Test authentication flows, file uploads, and RBAC restrictions.

*   **Static Analysis**:

    *   Run ESLint with security-focused plugins (e.g., `eslint-plugin-security`).

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, the Welcomedly team can ensure a robust security posture, protect user data, and maintain trust with stakeholders. Security is an ongoing process; periodically revisit and update these controls to address new threats and vulnerabilities.
