# Tech Stack Document for Welcomedly

This document explains, in everyday language, the technology choices behind the Welcomedly platform. It aims to show how each component contributes to a smooth user experience, reliable data handling, and future growth.

## Frontend Technologies

The frontend is what users see and interact with in their web browser. For Welcomedly, we chose:

*   **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)** • Lets us build HTML pages dynamically on the server, inserting user-specific data before the page reaches your browser.\
    • Simplifies the process of showing lists of campaigns, reports, and forms without writing low-level HTML each time.
*   **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** • Standard tools for structuring content (HTML), styling pages (CSS), and adding interactivity (JavaScript).\
    • Stored in a `public/` folder, these assets include any custom stylesheets, images, and fonts.
*   **Real-Time Updates** • Uses light WebSocket or polling techniques to refresh campaign and user activity data instantly.\
    • Delivers a live view of agent assignments, campaign pauses, and performance metrics without manual page reloads.

Together, these tools make the interface fast, responsive, and easy to maintain.

## Backend Technologies

The backend is the hidden engine that powers Welcomedly’s features, such as user login, data storage, and report generation. Our choices include:

*   **Node.js & Express.js**\
    • Node.js lets us run JavaScript on the server, ensuring a consistent language across the entire project.\
    • Express is a lightweight web framework that handles incoming requests (like login or form submissions) and routes them to the right part of the code.
*   **PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM**\
    • PostgreSQL is a reliable, high-performance relational database that stores campaigns, user profiles, and uploaded data.\
    • Sequelize is an “ORM” (Object-Relational Mapper) that makes database interactions feel like working with JavaScript objects, reducing the chance of errors when building queries.
*   **Authentication & Security**\
    • **bcrypt** secures user passwords by hashing them before storing in the database.\
    • Custom middleware checks each request to ensure only logged-in users (and, where needed, only administrators) can access certain pages or data.
*   **File Uploads & Data Processing**\
    • **multer** and **busboy** handle large file uploads (campaign spreadsheets, images), parse them safely, and hand off the data for validation and storage.\
    • Uploaded data gets validated, transformed, and saved in PostgreSQL to keep your campaigns organized and accurate.
*   **Utility Libraries**\
    • **moment.js** (and **moment-timezone**) for flexible date and time handling, making it easy to display times in different locales.\
    • **lodash** for handy data-manipulation functions, like sorting or filtering lists of campaigns and agents.\
    • **morgan** for logging every HTTP request, helping us debug issues quickly during development and production.
*   **TypeScript Typings**\
    • Although much of the code is JavaScript, we use `@types` packages to get IDE support and catch errors early.\
    • This combination boosts developer productivity and code reliability.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

To keep Welcomedly running efficiently and reliably, we use:

*   **Version Control with Git & GitHub**\
    • All source code lives in a Git repository, making it easy to track changes, collaborate, and roll back when needed.
*   **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**\
    • Automated pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) run tests and deploy new code when changes are merged, ensuring that updates reach production without manual steps.
*   **Hosting & Server Environment**\
    • The Node.js backend and PostgreSQL database can run on popular cloud platforms (AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku) or even in a serverless environment using **Cloudflare Workers** for parts of the API.\
    • Docker containers can be introduced later to guarantee that every environment (development, testing, staging, production) matches exactly.
*   **Monitoring & Logging**\
    • Tools like **morgan** logs on the server and optional external services (e.g., LogDNA, Datadog) track performance, errors, and usage patterns.

These practices ensure the app remains available, scales with demand, and recovers quickly from any outages.

## Third-Party Integrations

Welcomedly enhances its core features by integrating with external services:

*   **Cloudflare Workers** (optional)\
    • Enables serverless endpoints for highly scalable, low-latency API calls, especially useful for static content or public reporting.
*   **Validator Libraries**\
    • Packages like `validator.js` help sanitize and check user inputs (emails, URLs), protecting against malformed or malicious data.
*   **Potential Analytics & Notifications**\
    • Though not yet implemented, common integrations include Google Analytics for usage insights or Twilio/SendGrid for email and SMS notifications about campaign updates.

These integrations speed up development and add powerful capabilities without reinventing the wheel.

## Security and Performance Considerations

We’ve built Welcomedly with best practices to keep data safe and the experience snappy:

*   **Security Measures**\
    • **Password Hashing:** All user passwords use bcrypt to defend against database leaks.\
    • **Authentication Middleware:** Blocks unauthorized access to protected routes.\
    • **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Prevents injection attacks and ensures data conforms to expected formats.\
    • **File Upload Checks:** Limits file sizes and types to avoid resource abuse.
*   **Performance Optimizations**\
    • **Connection Pooling:** The `pg-pool` module reuses database connections, reducing latency for repeated queries.\
    • **Caching Strategies:** Easy to add in-memory or Redis caching for high-traffic report endpoints.\
    • **Source Maps:** Provide readable stack traces in production, making debugging faster without shipping unminified code.

These steps combine to deliver a smooth, secure experience for administrators and agents alike.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

Welcomedly brings together a proven set of tools to manage commercial campaigns effectively:

*   A **JavaScript-based full stack** (Node.js + Express + EJS) for consistency and developer productivity.
*   A **robust relational database** (PostgreSQL) with an ORM (Sequelize) for safe, efficient data handling.
*   **Security best practices** (bcrypt, input validation, auth middleware) that guard sensitive user and campaign data.
*   **Real-time features** and dynamic UIs that keep campaign managers informed without page reloads.
*   **Flexible deployment options** (cloud servers, Docker, serverless) that let the platform grow with demand.

By choosing these technologies, Welcomedly ensures a reliable, maintainable, and user-friendly system that can adapt to future needs. If you have any questions about specific tools or how they fit into the overall picture, feel free to ask!
